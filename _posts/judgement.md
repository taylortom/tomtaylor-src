With my graduation pretty imminent (all things going well), I've been reading up on job hunting/interviewing techniques etc. etc. and came across <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/1478/how-to-overcome-years-of-experience-requirements-when-applying-to-positions">this interesting comment thread</a> via <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, discussing the value of experience. I think one poster in particular hit the nail on the head:

<blockquote>Judgement comes not from success, but from failures. Most companies want to hire people that have had their failures paid for by previous companies</blockquote>

It's an interesting point to make that in order to achieve success, one must first experience failure. I sometimes find myself choosing the 'easier path' so as not to fail, but it's this failure which causes us to constantly evolve and grow.

<blockquote>Even the most skilled don't achieve success without a proportional amount of failure. This is how good judgement is earned.</blockquote>
