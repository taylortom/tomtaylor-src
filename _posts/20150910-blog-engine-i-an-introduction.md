I posted some time ago ([1st November 2014](http://tomtaylor.name/blog/2014/11/01/safe-water/) to be exact) about my intentions to write a Node.js blogging engine to replace the ramshackle Wordpress site I was using. I am pleased to report that it is finally (almost) done, and that it is this. After a month of stolen spare half hours, I've finally managed to get to the stage where I have something useful enough as to be usable. There's still [quite a bit to do](https://github.com/taylortom/taylortom-cli/issues), but I'm pretty happy with where it's at so far, especially as it's my first real Node outing.

If you're interested, the code for the engine is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/taylortom/taylortom-cli) (the website src is in another, undisclosed location).

In the next few weeks, I'll be writing about various aspects of this (hence the pt I in the name) with the hope that someone else may find this useful. For now though, I'd just like to present it in all its minimalistic glory.

Please have a look around, and keep your negative opinions to yourself <span class="icon-grin"></span>
