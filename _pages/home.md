I'm Tom: a Brighton-based programmer, tinkerer and coffee-drinker. I graduated from the University of Brighton in 2012, and have been having it large on the south coast ever since.

I'm currently working as an Open Source Learning Technologies Developer at <a href="http://www.kineo.com" target="_blank">City & Guilds Kineo</a> working full-time on the open-source <a href="https://community.adaptlearning.org/" target="_blank">Adapt project</a>.

I created this site as the main port of call for my professional services. You can find links to my various online profiles, as well as an up-to-date copy of my CV. My GitHub account is a good place to go to find some examples of projects I've worked on, as well as random little experiments.

I have skills and interests in the following areas:
