After a considerable hiatus, I thought it about time I started to give this blog a bit of love again.

Over the next few weeks/months, I’m going to be diving head-first into learning Node.js, and thought that I’d attempt to build my own simple blogging engine as a nice training exercise. I’ve been meaning to replace the Wordpress site I currently use for a while (which is a bit bloated for my needs, and is always a massive headache to re-theme any time I decide to update my website), so what better way than to build my own?!

Wish me luck.
