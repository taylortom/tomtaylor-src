It's not too surprising that Steve Jobs and his methods have been discussed Â pretty extensively over the last few months. While reading one such article (viewable <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/10/steve_jobs_solved_the_innovato.html">here</a>), I came across a nice quote from a supposed exec who has previously worked for both Apple and Microsoft:

<blockquote>Microsoft tries to find pockets of unrealized revenue and then figures out what to make. Apple is just the opposite: It thinks of great products, then sells them. Prototypes and demos always come before spreadsheets.</blockquote>

The origin of the quote is really irrelevant; if more companies picked up this mantra, the world would surely be a much more awesome place.
