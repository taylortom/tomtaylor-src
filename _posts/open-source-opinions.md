Came across <a href="http://community.redhat.com/blog/2015/01/quotes-from-open-source-past/">this article</a> on Hacker News, which has some interesting reflections on the perception of open source software in 2015 (as well as some quotes that may leave some Microsoft employees slightly red in the face).

<blockquote>No longer is open source the alternative. It is the mainstream.

If, at the beginning of the 21st Century, we had recalled this quote from French author Gustave Flaubert, we would not have been surprised by this outcome for open software:

"You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it."</blockquote>
