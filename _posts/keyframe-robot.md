Here's a little key-frame animation I made using 3DS Max for a university project. I was going for a cartoon-y almost cell-shaded look, so chose soft lighting and went for matt, bump-mapped textures. I wanted to get a nice contrast between light and dark, so chose to use spotlights rather than any natural global illumination-type light sources (although the finished product looks a bit more gloomy than I'd intended). The robot was (quite obviously) inspired by Wall-E.
